The presented code is for computing stochastic optimal controllers as described in the publication
"" for an Omni-directional robot.

To compile the code

$g++ -fopenmp -o EXE_FILE_NAME main.cpp computeProbability.cpp

To disable the code from using parallel remove "-fopenmp".

The code will store value of function g(q) and stores it in a text file.
Please use the MATLAB code to visualize the data and use it with further processing.
