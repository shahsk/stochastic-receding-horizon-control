The presented code is for computing stochastic optimal controllers as described in the publication
Shridhar Shah, Herbert Tanner, Chetan Pahlajani"Stochastic receding horizon control of nonlinear stochastic systems
with probabilistic state constraints", Transactions of Automatic Control (In Review) for an Omni-directional robot.

To compile the code

$g++ -fopenmp -o EXE_FILE_NAME main.cpp computeProbability.cpp

To disable the code from using all processor cores remove "-fopenmp".

The code will store value of function g(q) and stores it in a text file.
Please use the MATLAB code to visualize the data and use it with further processing.
